## Generate Results
Before reproducing the results ensure that the following files are downloaded from the dropox link above and placed in the "machine_learning_spring_2023/data" folder:
1. bank-full.csv

Also ensure that the dependencies in requirements.txt are installed.

Option 1:
1. Start jupyter noteook from the root folder of the source code, i.e. "/machine_learning_spring_2023"
2. Open the "Neural Network Optimization Comparison Results.ipynb" notebook in the "/machine_learning_spring_2023/results" folder and run each cell
3. Open the "FlipFlop Results.ipynb" notebook in the "/machine_learning_spring_2023/results" folder and run each cell
4. Open the "Rastrigin Results.ipynb" notebook in the "/machine_learning_spring_2023/results" folder and run each cell
5. Open the "Knapsack Results.ipynb" notebook in the "/machine_learning_spring_2023/results" folder and run each cell
