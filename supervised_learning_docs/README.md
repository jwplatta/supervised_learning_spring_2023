## Generate Results
Before reproducing the results ensure that the following files are downloaded from the dropox link above and placed in the "supervised_learning_spring_2023/data" folder:
1. bank-full.csv
2. snli_1.0_train.jsonl
3. snli_1.0_test.jsonl
4. snli_word2vec.model

Also ensure that the dependencies in requirements.txt are installed.

Option 1:
1. Start jupyter noteook from the root folder of the source code, i.e. "/supervised_learning_spring_2023"
2. Open the "Bank Data Results.ipynb" notebook in the "/supervised_learning_spring_2023/results" folder and run each cell
3. Open the "SNLI Results.ipynb" notebook in the "/supervised_learning_spring_2023/results" folder and run each cell

Option 2:
1. From the top folder of "/supervised_learning_spring_2023" run the script "bank_data_results.py"
2. From the top folder of "/supervised_learning_spring_2023" run the script "snli_results.py"
